# EUROSTAXX50-Portfolios_Returns_with_Efficient_Frontier
In this working project in excel, I examined 3 insurance stocks (Allianz, AXA, Munich RE) belonging to the EURO STOXX50 index.


Starting from the historical price series (adj. close) of the three stocks,
exploiting logarithmic returns and various financial tools,
I managed to construct an efficient frontier,
in line with the financial theory developed by Harry Markowitz.
